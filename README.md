# Snapshot_Optimisation
A computationally efficient flow reconstruction technique, exploiting homogeneity, to recreate 3D instantaneous turbulent velocity fields from snapshots of 2D planar fields. This methodology, termed as ‘snapshot optimisation’ or SO, can help provide 3D data-sets from 2D data restricted by the limitations of experimental measurement techniques.
